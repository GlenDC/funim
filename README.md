# FIM: Functional Inner Mechanics

A game made for the #monstergamejam in Brussels, 2014. The theme was: "inner mechanics".

This game is meant as an experiment of making games in a functional language. A big thanks to [joakin/cnake](https://github.com/joakin/cnake), as it provided me with some nice bootstrap code.
